# Compact • ST-20251113-act-007-01-entity-design

## Confirmed
- `docs/local_data_model.md` continues to capture the full ER design + per-table specs for terms, campuses, subjects, instructors, courses, sections, meetings, subscription-related tables, open-section snapshots, and the search view, satisfying the entity-model subtask scope (docs/local_data_model.md:1-335).
- SOC→local field mappings and derived-field guidance (credits, prerequisites, delivery mode, search vectors) remain documented to cover FR-01/FR-02 filtering needs (docs/local_data_model.md:296-337).
- The meeting-time conversion note now special-cases hour `12` before applying the PM offset, so 12:00 PM persists as 720 minutes and 12:00 AM as 0, preventing noon/midnight wraparound that would break FR-02 time filters (docs/local_data_model.md:333).
- `record.json` already reflects this subtask as `done`; no status changes were required for this review cycle.

## Interface / Behavior Changes
- Documentation-only clarification; the intended ingest logic now explicitly requires handling 12 AM/PM correctly when computing `section_meetings.start_minutes`/`end_minutes`.

## Self-test
- Content-only fix; no automated or manual runtime tests run.

## Risks / TODO
- Schema/migration tooling (`scripts/migrate_db.*`, SQL DDL) still needs to be implemented per the documented design.
- Any future SOC payload drift (field renames, missing pmCode) will require revalidating the conversion guidance and possibly the schema.
