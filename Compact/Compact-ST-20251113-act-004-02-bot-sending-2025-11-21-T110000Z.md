# ST-20251113-act-004-02-bot-sending

- Added Discord bot sender (`notifications/discord/bot.ts`) with config loader, token-bucket throttling, DM/channel resolution, retry/backoff on 429/5xx, and redacted logging.
- CLI helper `scripts/discord_send_test.ts` (`npm run discord:test-send -- --config <path> --channel <id> --message "text"`) sends verification pings with optional dry-run/trace.
- Node test (`notifications/discord/tests/bot.test.ts`) stubs fetch to cover success, rate-limit retry, and DM channel creation flows.
