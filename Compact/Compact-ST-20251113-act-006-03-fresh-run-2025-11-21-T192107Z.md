Subtask: ST-20251113-act-006-03-fresh-run (status set to done in record.json at 2025-11-21T17:32:00Z)

Facts implemented
- Added retry wrapper for SOC probes in scripts/fetch_soc_data.ts: courses/openSections calls now retry up to 3x with linear backoff (2s base; openSections uses 3s base) before failing.
- Added duplicate-course guard in applySubjectBatch: skips repeated courseNumbers per subject when courses.json contains duplicates, logging a warning instead of raising UNIQUE constraint errors.
- New docs: docs/quickstart.md (WSL2-tested local bring-up, troubleshooting, verification), README.md now surfaces quick start, core scripts, and doc links.
- Fresh install log recorded at reports/fresh_install_log.md (env: WSL2 Ubuntu, Node 24.11.1 from tarball, python3 present; full-init timings and issue list).
- .gitignore now excludes data/staging/ and configs/*.local.json; record.json updated to mark the subtask complete.

Behavior / interface changes to watch
- Data fetch pipeline is more tolerant: duplicates are skipped rather than erroring; transient SOC network issues for courses/openSections are retried automatically. Downstream scripts using fetch_soc_data.ts inherit this behavior.

Tests / run results
- Command: PATH="/tmp/node-v24.11.1/bin:$PATH" ./scripts/setup_local_env.sh --db data/fresh_local.db --terms 12024 --campuses NB
  - npm install (root+frontend) succeeded; migrations 001–003 applied on fresh DB.
  - Full-init fetch completed ~26s; duplicate-course warnings emitted but skipped; openSections initial attempt failed with NETWORK, retry succeeded.
  - Output summary: logs/fetch_runs/summary_latest.{log,json}; counts in data/fresh_local.db → courses=4506, sections=11467.

Risks / TODO
- System Node still missing; current success depended on /tmp/node-v24.11.1 PATH override. Install Node 22+ and reinstall deps to avoid environment drift.
- openSections remains subject to network flakiness; retries added but intermittent failures may still require rerun.
- DB path used in the run is data/fresh_local.db; ensure run_stack.sh or further fetches point to the same DB or recreate as needed.
